<p style="text-align:center"><b>Description:</b> In this experiment, you will see two pictures for every item. The pictures will include pictures of animals, plants, dishes, or fruits. For each item, you will see two pictures. The first picture will show a point of time, and the second picture will show an earlier or later point of time compared to the first picture. 
The task is to determine wether the second picture comes at an "earlier" point of time or "later" point of time compared to the first picture.
Based on your opinion, you will either click on the black square for a "later point of time" or the white square for an "earlier point of time".
Click on the button "Go" once you are ready to practice with an example before beginning.</p>
